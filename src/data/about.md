# Intro

I went to school for Agricultural Business because I knew it was easier to get into Cal Poly for, then once I was there I didn't see a need to switch, now I'm a software engineer ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

# Currently

I am the owner of [Shakely Consulting](https://shakely-consulting.github.io/shakely-consulting).

# Some history

- In the summer of 1996, my uncle purchased [MegaRace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaRace) from [Media Play](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Play) and installed it on my mom's work computer. I might have endangered her business by using her computer too much.

# I like

- The 49ers.

# Travel / Geography

- I am from originally from Sacramento, California. I have since lived in San Luis Obispo, Barcelona, Santa Barbara, Sacramento, San Francisco, and Ventura.
- Ventura is the worst of these.
- San Luis Obispo, Barcelona, Santa Barbara, San Francisco (pre-COVID) were all cool.
